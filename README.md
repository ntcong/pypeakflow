Python library for Arbor Peakflow SP

I want to write a library for interacting with Peakflow SP, needed a starting point and found pypeakflow. The original project is pretty much dead so I forked it in order to do those things:

- Use one SOAP library only, remove suds and ZSI for a better client
- Support for Python3. I aimed for Python3 only, Python2 support may come as an extra
- Support for newer SOAP API in Arbor.

Usage
-----

For now just use `py.test`.
